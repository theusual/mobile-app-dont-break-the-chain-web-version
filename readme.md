Don''t Break The Chain -- A  mobile app for helping users easily and enjoyably track progress towards goals. Useful for both making and breaking habits, the user can graphically mark each day that their daily goal is achieved, creating a ""chain"" of days representing success. 

The app is available across all mobile platforms and works both online and offline. All goal progress synchronizes properly across all platforms.

This is the code for the WEB version of the project, hosted on a web server and accessible via a web browser.
